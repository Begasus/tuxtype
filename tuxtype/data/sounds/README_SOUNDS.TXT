About The Sound Files Used In This Game
---------------------------------------

Some of the sound files used in this game were made exclusively
by myself (Sam Hart, <hart@geekcomix.com>) and I place under the
Gnu GPL as dictated by the COPYING file in the root directory of
this archive. Those files are:

excuseme.wav
bite.wav
run.wav
splat.wav

Sam got the following two files from a CD with copyright-free stuff 
("they were sounds you could legally use to sample, remix, use 
elsewhere, without having to get permission or any acknowledgement 
back to the author"):

win.wav 	 	
winfinal.wav


The following files are taken from tuxmath and where made by 
Bill Kendrick <bill@newbreedsoftware.com> - the files are also 
place under the GPL:

explosion.wav  	-> also used in tuxmath
alarm.wav	-> also used in tuxmath
buzz.wav	-> also used in tuxmath
game.mod
game2.mod
game3.mod
laser.wav
lose.wav	-> also used in tuxmath
pause.wav	
pop.wav		-> also used in tuxmath
shieldsdown.wav	-> also used in tuxmath
tock.wav
tuxi.ogg


Problematic files:
click.wav 		-> no clue, maybe from kde
funkbrt.it 		-> from one of those sites
kmus1.wav		-> from wavplace?.com (which is offline)
kmus2.wav		-> from wavplace?.com (which is offline)
kmus3.wav		-> from wavplace?.com (which is offline)
kmus4.wav 		-> from wavplace?.com (which is offline)

The remainder files were gathered from the following sources (I
tried out so many files that I forget where each specifically
came from... sorry):

http://www.partnersinrhyme.com/
http://www.wavplace.com/
http://www.wavplace2.com/
http://www.musicloops.com/

Each file was either declared in the public domain, or was
allowed to be used freely in non-comercial products. This game
is under the Gnu GPL (again, see COPYING) and is
open-source. While this does not preclude it from being included
in a comercial packade (such as a Linux distro) this software is
required to be freely distributable. Thus, it is not comercial.

If you have any further questions (or you feel a sound file used
in this open-source game has a copyright conflicting enough to
not be included with a Gnu GPL software title) please contact me
at hart@geekcomix.com

Thx.
