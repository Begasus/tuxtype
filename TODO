-Clean up code! (Someone beat it severely with the "oogly stick"!)

-In playgame.c lines 1288-1339, 1353-1404, and 1418-1469 are almost exactly
 the same. These need to be modularized and stuck in their own function.
 (Did it this way because I was lazy when I wrote this part, and was just
 trying to make game work.... not that it does, I have no excuse ;)

-In playgame.c, kascade routines, still have occassional graphic remnants
 after tux has finished moving which need to be resolved (presently, I
 have only found continuing problems 1) at end animation [yipe and win],
 and 2) after gulp [this happens very rarely]).

-Update this TODO list ;-)
