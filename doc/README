    Additional information on this subject is covered in "HowToTheme.html"
    in the "docs" directory of this package.

This is version 1.7.0 of Tux Typing.

In Fish Cascade you control Tux as he searches for fish to eat. Fish fall
from the top of the screen. These fish have letters on them.  Unforunately
for Tux, eating a fish with a letter on it will cause his stomach to
become ill, so it is up to you to help Tux eat fish!  By typing the
letters, it will cause them to disappear so tux can chow down on the 
fish.

In Comet Zap you control Tux as he defends the cities from comets.  To
protect a city from a comet, type the letter on the comet and it will
cause Tux to destroy it with a laser! (In case you wondered, Comet Zap
is an adaptation of the *great* math drill game, "Tux, of Math Command").

"Lessons" and "Practice" are additional typing activities. "Practice" 
involves typing phrases or complete sentences, with measurment of accuracy
and typing speed. "Lessons" uses XML-based scripting to run various other
parts of the program in a specified order, including the "Practice" activity.
These features are not yet completed, but represent ways to add additional
"content" without requiring more programming per se. You will find other
menu entries for planned features that still need to be implemented.

Tux Typing is Free-Software, distributable under the GNU General Public
License. Please read COPYING for more info.

Also, for those who may or may not be wondering: Yes, the rumors are
true.... Tux Typing has a few special `hidden' options. See if you can 
figure out what it is... ;)

Enjoy!
