The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz
Once upon a midnight dreary,
While I pondered, weak and weary,
O'er many a quaint and curious volume
Of forgotten lore.
As I nodded, nearly napping,
Suddenly there came a rapping,
As of someone gently tapping,
Tapping at my chamber door.
'Tis a visitor, I muttered.
Only this, and nothing more.
This above all, to thine own self be true.
And it will follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
