About The Sound Files Used In This Game
---------------------------------------

Some of the sound files used in this game were made exclusively by myself (Sam
Hart, <hart@geekcomix.com>) and I place under the Gnu GPL as dictated by the
COPYING file in the root directory of this archive. Those files are:

excuseme.wav
bite.wav
run.wav
splat.wav

Sam got the following two files from a CD with copyright-free stuff ("they were
sounds you could legally use to sample, remix, use elsewhere, without having to
get permission or any acknowledgement back to the author"):

win.wav 	 	
winfinal.wav


The following files are taken from tuxmath and where made by Bill Kendrick
<bill@newbreedsoftware.com> - the files are also place under the GPL:

explosion.wav  	-> also used in tuxmath
alarm.wav	-> also used in tuxmath
buzz.wav	-> also used in tuxmath
game.mod
game2.mod
game3.mod
laser.wav
lose.wav	-> also used in tuxmath
pause.wav	
pop.wav		-> also used in tuxmath
shieldsdown.wav	-> also used in tuxmath
tock.wav

tuxi.ogg	Emmett Plant emmett@sonivius.com licence: public domain



"Problematic" files:
click.wav 		-> no clue, maybe from kde
funkbrt.it 		-> from http://www.partnersinrhyme.com/ or http://www.musicloops.com/
 
 
kmus1.wav		-> from http://wavplace.com or wavplace.2 (which is offline)
kmus2.wav		-> ditto (which is offline)
kmus3.wav		-> ditto (which is offline)
kmus4.wav 		-> ditto (which is offline)

Each file was either declared in the public domain, or was allowed to be used
freely in non-comercial products. 


This game is under the Gnu GPL (again, see COPYING) and is open-source. While
this does not preclude it from being included in a comercial packade (such as a
Linux distro) this software is required to be freely distributable. Thus, it is
not comercial.

If you have any further questions (or you feel a sound file used in this
open-source game has a copyright conflicting enough to not be included
with a Gnu GPL software title) please contact me at hart@geekcomix.com

Thx.
