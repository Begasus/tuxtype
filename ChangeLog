[ David Bruce]
       - Code cleanup - funcs.h revised, unneeded "extern" keywords for
         function prototypes removed, prototypes rearranged into alpha-
         betical order
       - All functions now have function prototypes, either in funcs.h or
         local function prototypes with explicit static scope.
       - const keyword added to pointer function args when appropriate,
         usually char* args.
       - Renaming of some functions and variables to make capitalization 
         more internally consistent (e.g. ALLCAPS means constant or other
         preprocessor macro, CamelCase means globally visible, while 
         local_functions() use lowercase connected by underscores).

       - Fixed vertical alignment problem with certain non-US characters
         such as "Å" by checking max_y of each glyph and adjusting
         appropriately.
       - Added Doulos font to svn to accomodate Russian, although no code
         yet to use this font when it is needed.
       - Added utility function to print keymap - it appears that the
         existing keymap code is broken, as the KEYMAP[] array winds
         up with KEYMAP[i] == i for all values no matter what the
         keyboard.lst file says.

[ David Bruce]
       - Additional work on UTF-8/Unicode issues - program now scans
         word list to see what Unicode characters are needed instead
         of automatically rendering everything from 0-255. It now
         displays chars beyond this range (e.g. Russian/Cyrillic) as
         long as the font contains the needed glyphs (which Andika 
         does not, as of yet). Display "should" now work correctly
         except for a cosmetic problem with vertical alignment, which
         should be fixed soon. Files - alphabet.c, playgame.c, laser.c.
       - Lowercase keystrokes for non-US characters converted to upper-
         case, just like A-Z.  Not sure this addresses keyboard input
         problems just yet.
       - Changed font to Andika design review "G".

v.1.5.9  07 May 2007

[ David Bruce]
       - Overhauled internal handling of word lists to handle UTF-8
         correctly. Now WORDS_use() converts the UTF-8 to wchar_t
         (i.e. Unicode) arrays for internal handling. The letters for
         the fish and comets are now generated by black_outline_wchar(),
         which is a modification of black_outline() that uses
         TTF_RenderGlyph() instead of TTF_RenderUTF8().  It now seems
         to work correctly, but for now is limited to the 0-255 range.

v.1.5.8  29 Apr 2007

[ Karl Ove Hufthammer ]
       - Converted all the translation to use the UTF-8 characters.
       - Changed word files to UTF-8. 
	   - Added improved French word files commited by the French
	     Skolelinux/Debian-edu team during DevCamp in Soissons.
	   - Added Brazilian Portuguese translation by
	     Hudson Gonçalves Manieri Figueredo.

[ David Bruce]
       - Changed TTF_RenderText to TTF_RenderUTF8 everywhere in 
         playgame.c, mainly by removing ttf_letter() and using
         black_outline() instead.
       - Added some checks for null pointers to prevent segfaults.
       - Changed backgrounds from png to jpg to save space.
       - Removed other unused backgrounds
         (now in people/dbruce/unused_images)

[ David Bruce ] 21 Apr 2007
       - (mostly) removed used of checkFile() as it doesn't work
         reliably on Windows and isn't really necessary. 


v.1.5.7

[ David Bruce ]
       - Changed font to Andika (hopefully will have this in Debian
         and other OS in future so we don't have to bundle it
         indefinitely)
       - Fixed black_outline() to make it work more or less as was
         intended, from what I can tell.

v1.5.6	the "make it simply work, stupid" release (a pun on KISS)

[ Holger Levsen ]
       - tagged as release in svn
       - brought back the tuxtype2 logo
       - updated TODO and README
       - reverted utf8-changes from r16-20, as utf8 support needs more code
         changes
       - workaround debian bug #374062
       - remove funkbrt.it as its not used
       - font-loading is still a ugly hack :-( but works on debian with
         ttf-gentium, which requires a little code-change for a sarge backport
       - macosx and windows version untested...

v1.5.5   development version, not released (still font+sound issues)

[ Calvin Arndt ]
       - closing all the mem leaks I know of 
       - remove redundant print_phrase()
       - remove hard coded xy positions in print_at() (calculate wrapped y position)
       - remove uneeded cast in Phrases()
[ Holger Levsen ]
       - renamed to tuxtype (from tuxtype2), also modified the logo :)
       - Solving the sound file licence issues (removed one (tickle.wav, was
         unused), updated README_SOUNDS.TXT - this is not finished yet!!!!
       - removed all fonts. The font-handling is still a hack,
         see loaders.c - it only uses fonts from ttf-freefont
         and not yet from ttf-dejavu (for non-latini fonts) - and it only
         works on Debian probably (fixed path, not suitable for Windows,
         MacOS and probably other linux distributions)

v1.5.4 - Added Norwegian Bokmål translation. Improved Norwegian
         Nynorsk translation.

v1.5.3 - Initial lesson code started. Changed Set Keyboard to
	 be a project info page. Fixed CometZap random segfaults on
	 versions of NT. Added scripting for lessons. Used scripting
	 mimic old instructions for Fish Cascade. Replaced
	 SDL_WM_ToggleFullScreen() in favor of a more portable 
	 routine to accomplish window size toggling. F10 in menu
	 toggles screen size. Added saving sound volumes and windows
	 state in the config file. Tuxtype2 now remembers both!
	 Added translations Euskara, Italian and Jamaican. Added
	 code for a map and photo for each theme/translation.

v1.5.1 - Changed to get word list name from first line of file.
         More language fixes. Added spanish translation. Fix 
	 typos in source. Build system fixes. Added spanish
	 translation. New word files for nynorsk translation.
	 Danish translation bug fixes and cleanup. Changed format
	 of keyboard.lst file. Added mouse click selection in language
	 screen. And much more. Enjoy!

	(such as my laptop >:/ )
	
v.0.5pre1 - Begin work on WORDCASCADE: All screens found and added-
	Added word loading option and words- levels cycle- not
