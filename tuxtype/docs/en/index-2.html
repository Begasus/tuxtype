<!---------- TO EDIT --------->
<i>(The following is a rough estimate, anyone care to test this software
out and give me better numbers?)</i>
<br><br>
<!---------- END TO EDIT ---------->

Tux Typing requires a computer with the following hardware as a minimum:
<ul>
<li>200 Mhz Pentium class CPU</li>
<li>32 Megs of RAM</li>
<li>2 Megs Video RAM</li>
<li>80 Megs of Hard Drive space (if downloading the entire source code as well as installing binaries)</li>
<li>Keyboard and Mouse</li>
</ul>
However, it is recommended that you have at least:
<ul>
<li>300 Mhz Pentium II clase CPU</li>
<li>64 Megs of RAM</li>
<li>4 Megs Video RAM</li>
<li>80 Megs of Hard Drive space</li>
<li>Keyboard and Mouse</li>
</ul>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Compilation and installation</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>In order to compile and install Tux Typing on your system, as root (superuser) type the following in
the base directory of the Tuxtype distribution:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Since Tux Typing uses
<PRE>
autoconf
</PRE>
 you should have not trouble
compiling it.
Should you run into problems please report them to the the author at 
<A HREF="mailto:hart@geekcomix.com">Sam Hart</A><P>
If you obtained a binary distribution of Tux Typing (eg, in a format such as RPM or DEB)
then please consult your documentation on how to install such packages on your system.

<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.3 Installing Optional Themes</A>
</H2>

<p>As of version 1.0pre1, Tux Typing has support for optional themes. These themes can be anything from alternative language
support to alternative graphic themes or word files. Over the 1.1-1.2 development cycle we plan on finalizing this theme
support, however, for now you can utilize themes via the command line.</p>

<p>To install a new theme, you first must obtain a theme from:
<blockquote><a href="http://www.geekcomix.com/dm/tuxtype/themes/">http://www.geekcomix.com/dm/tuxtype/themes/</a></blockquote>
This theme will come in the form of a ZIP file.</p>

<p>Uncompress this ZIP file using whatever compression utility your OS supports, and place the directory contents inside your
Tux Typing data directory. On Unix systems this is typically /usr/local/share/tuxtype/ or /usr/share/tuxtype/ whereas on Win32 and
BeOS it is whereever you installed Tux Typing.</p>

<p>Once you have installed the theme, you activate the theme by running Tux Typing with the "--theme" or "-t" options. For example,
if I had installed the theme "french" on my system, I would activate this theme with the following command line:
<blockquote><pre>tuxtype --theme french</pre></blockquote>
</p>
