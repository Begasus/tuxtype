    information.  Dansk is currently the only complete theme for TT2.


In Fish Cascade you control Tux as he searches for fish to eat. Fish fall
from the top of the screen. These fish have letters on them.  Unforunate
for Tux, eating a fish with a letter on it will cause his stomach to
become ill, so it is up to you to help Tux eat fish!  By typing the
letters, it will cause them to disappear so tux can chow down on the 
fish.

In Comet Zap you control tux as he defends the city from comets.  To
protect a city from a comet, type the letter on the comet and it will
cause tux to destroy it with a laser!

Also, for those who may or may not be wondering: Yes, the rumors are
true.... Tux Typing has a few special `hidden' options. See if you can 
figure out what it is... ;)

Enjoy!
