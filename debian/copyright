the following is a verbose copy of the contents of
/usr/share/tuxtype/data/images/README_IMAGES.TXT and applies to the
files in /usr/share/tuxtype/data/images/ provided by the tuxtype-data
package:

About The Images Used In This Game
----------------------------------

The majority of the graphics used in this title were made
exclusively by myself (Sam Hart, <hart@geekcomix.com>) and I
place under the Gnu GPL (as dictated by the COPYING file in the
root directory of this archive). These images were created
either natively in the GIMP (http://www.gimp.org/) or were hand
drawn, scanned, and manipulated via the GIMP.

Tux was originally drawn by Larry Ewing <ltlewing@isc.tamu.edu>. 
Certain images used in this game were modified from his original 
Tux images found at http://www.isc.tamu.edu/~lewing/linux/

The remainder of the images, are from a number of public domain
sources. Specifically, they are from the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service (FWS). The archives for these services were accessed
through the GIMP-Savvy web-site at

http://gimp-savvy.com/PHOTO-ARCHIVE/

Those images which were obtained from either of these US
government agencies were:

kcas1_1.gif
kcas1_2.gif
kcas1_3.gif
kcas1_4.gif
kcas2_1.gif
kcas2_2.gif
kcas2_3.gif
kcas2_4.gif
kcas3_1.gif
kcas3_2.gif
kcas3_3.gif
kcas3_4.gif

wcas1_1.gif
wcas1_2.gif
wcas1_3.gif
wcas1_4.gif
wcas2_1.gif
wcas2_2.gif
wcas2_3.gif
wcas2_4.gif
wcas3_1.gif
wcas3_2.gif
wcas3_3.gif
wcas3_4.gif

I'm pretty sure that covers everything that may potentially
cause problems... but just in case I left something out, I can
assure you that any image used in this game was freely
distributable to the best of my knowledge.

Thx.

(PS: As a reward for those of you that read these readme files,
you may notice a file called "hidden.gif" in this directory. The
image is royalty free from same places as *cas*.gif files above
are. But what's significant about it is that it's a special hidden
background level. Simply use "tuxtype --hidden" to use it as the
default background for level 4 on each difficulty level! Enjoy! ;)

the following is a verbose copy of the contents of
/usr/share/tuxtype/data/sounds/README_SOUNDS.TXT and applies to the
files in /usr/share/tuxtype/data/sounds/ provided by the tuxtype-data
package:

About The Sound Files Used In This Game
---------------------------------------

Some of the sound files used in this game were made exclusively by myself (Sam
Hart, <hart@geekcomix.com>) and I place under the Gnu GPL as dictated by the
COPYING file in the root directory of this archive. Those files are:

excuseme.wav
bite.wav
run.wav
splat.wav

The following files are taken from tuxmath and where made by Bill Kendrick
<bill@newbreedsoftware.com> - the files are also place under the GPL:

game.mod
game2.mod
game3.mod
laser.wav
pause.wav
tock.wav
explosion.wav  
alarm.wav
buzz.wav
lose.wav
pop.wav
shieldsdown.wav

Sam got the following two files from a CD with copyright-free stuff ("they were
sounds you could legally use to sample, remix, use elsewhere, without having to
get permission or any acknowledgement back to the author"):

win.wav          
winfinal.wav


Emmett Plant (emmett@sonivius.com) is the author of tuxi.ogg and released it in the public domain.

This game is under the Gnu GPL (again, see COPYING) and is open-source. While
this does not preclude it from being included in a commercial packade (such as a
Linux distro) this software is required to be freely distributable. 

If you have any further questions (or you feel a sound file used in this
open-source game has a copyright conflicting enough to not be included
with a Gnu GPL software title) please contact me at hart@geekcomix.com

Thx.

-----------------------------------------

10 Sep 2009

ADDENDUM - the previously present files with license problems (kmus1-4.wav, click.wav) have all been removed
and replaced with 100% free and redistributable alternatives.  I believe the sound files in Tux Typing are
now fully compliant with the Debian Free Software Guidelines.

        Rachana is a language campaign forum for the Original script of Malayalam
        in the digital computing. It started in 1999 under the leadership of
        R. Chitrajakumar (Malayalam Lexicon, Kerala University, Palayalm,
        Thiruvananthapuram). Hussain KH (KFRI, Kerala Forest Research Institute,
        Peechi, Thrissur) is the project coordinator who designed the font.
        Other Members are:  Gangadharan N (Malayalam Lexicon) who assisted
        Chitrajakumar in compiling the exhaustive character set of Malayalam;
        Dr. P Vijayakumaran Nair (KFRI) who assisted in programming the Rachana
        text editor which was used by many from 1999 to 2005 to typeset Books
        and journal articles in the old Lipi; Subash Kuriakose (KFRI) who gave
        advice to Hussain in the many aspects of Malayalam calligraphy. Later in
        2004 Rajeev J Sebastian joined the Rachana team, whose mastery in Linux
        and untiring work is elevating the campaign to materialize its highest
        dream that to embed the original script in the OS enabling it in the
        whole field of digital applications. Dr. Mammen Chundamannil (KFRI) is
        an ardent supporter and well wisher of Rachana whose article 'For our
        language, our script' has spread the vision and objectives of Rachana to
        the whole world.

        There seems to be some confusion regarding the license of Rachana.
        Praveen has confirmed that Rachana is indeed under GPL. Any queries
        regarding the exact status of Rachana license issue should be directed
        to Praveen <pravi.a@gmail.com>
