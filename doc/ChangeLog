        - ChooseListToEdit() and EditWordList() in editor.h/c now used by program, old functions
        commented out.  Code cleanup ongoing.  Added two more copies of NewWordList.png - to be

[ David Bruce <davidstuartbruce@gmail.com> ]
        - Created files editor.h/c for word list editing code as titlescreen is really just
        supposed to be the menu system.  Copied ChooseFile() and ChooseWord() into these files
        and renamed them ChooseListToEdit() and EditWordList().  They are not yet active code.

30 Jun 2009 
[Sarah Frisk <ssfrisk@gmail.com> ]
	-Changed it so that wordlists are by the the name of the first word in file
	-Discovered what is causing images not showing up.  Apparently there is some memory issue that I've been working on for several days that causes any custom images not to appear when wordlists are added.  
	Line issue:  strncpy( fileNames[themes++], themesFile->d_name, FNLEN-1 );
	Commenting this out makes images show up again, but unfortunately makes the program unusable since we don't actually have a wordlist to work with.

20 July 2009
[Sarah Frisk <ssfrisk@gmail.com> ]
	-Started setting up visually the word list editor
	-Some issues with loading images and making them appear.  Attempting to fix this.

	- made it so you can't edit the first word in a wordlist, since this is the title.
	- fixed a few bugs.

[Sarah Frisk <ssfrisk@gmail.com> ]
	-changed the names of the word*.png files to fit the list*.png conventions

[Sarah Frisk <ssfrisk@gmail.com> ]
	-fixed bug where deleting all the words in a word list causes the program to

[ Sarah Frisk <ssfrisk@gmail.com> ]
	- Fixed spacing issue in ChooseWord()
	- Fixed random garbage adding in ChooseWord()
	- Simplified ChooseWord() in general
	- For the most part ChooseWord() functionality is finished.  What is left is to had a 
	more comprehensible GUI than what is currently there (which involves figuring out how to 
	move the wordlist editor from the top left hand corner of the screen).  Also need to make 
	is so ChooseFile() can create wordlists, but that should be easy since the set up of that 
	function is very similar to ChooseWord().

        - Build - changed file permissions on installed localstatedir and sysconfdir

		- Custom Word Lists Configuration Program (titlescreen.c):
		- Cleaned up the previous wordlist configure functions to make code more readable/fix
		  previous bug errors.
		- Fixed issue where the wordlist reads the first word in the list as
		  title name.  Need to get rid of the the .txt bit at the end, but 
		  currently reads everything correctly. NOTE: the current wordlist editor is
		  reading the first word in the wordlist as the name of the list.
		- Lets the user choose a custom wordlist in the choose wordlist menu before
		  playing a game.
		- Fixed the backspace button in wordlist editor to prevent bus errors
		- Return key now recognizes a new word.  Still a few bugs in this though, since
		  random characters are getting passed into the new word occasionally.

06 Jun 2009 (svn.debian.org/tux4kids - revision 1013)
[ David Bruce <davidstuartbruce@gmail.com> ]
        - Paths - added support for localstatedir (shared modifiable data, generally
          located under /var) and sysconfdir (program-wide settings, generally located
          under /etc) to autotools build system.  Also updated the game_option_type struct
          to have a field for the shared modifiable data - var_data_path.  This is the
          intended location for shared custom word lists, high scores, and so forth.

        - Code organization - TransWipe() and all of the blitting queue functions
          moved from playgame.c into SDL_extras.c/.h. Some safety checks and other
          cleanup added along the way.

Version 1.7.4
[ David Bruce <davidstuartbruce@gmail.com> ]
        - Build - configure.ac updated to only link to SDL_ttf when SDL_Pango is
          unavailable; also added configure option "--without-sdlpango" to facilitate
          testing of program when SDL_ttf is used.

03 Mar 2009 (svn.debian.org/tux4kids - revision 923)
[ David Bruce <davidstuartbruce@gmail.com> ]
        - Text drawing - encapsulation of all calls to SDL_ttf and SDL_Pango to 
          within SDL_extras.c/.h.  The rest of the program no longer "knows" which
          text library is being used.  Now, since SDL_ttf is no longer used at all
          whenever SDL_Pango is available, we don't need any specific fonts for Linux.

22 Feb 2009 svn revision 903
[ David Bruce <davidstuartbruce@gmail.com> ]
        - lots of general code cleanup to eliminate most of the compiler warnings, 
          including removal of remaining incorrect uses of "unsigned char".
        - addition of "make dist_with_fonts_bzip2" target to help support OpenSUSE
          build service integration.
        - beginning of VERSION "1.7.4.preview"
        - cleanup of alphabet.c with addition of pointer safety checks and fix of 
          "off-by-one" drawing error in fourth row of keyboard hints graphic.

08 Feb 2009 
[ David Bruce <davidstuartbruce@gmail.com> ]
        - cleanup of wchar_t <--> UTF-8 conversion wrapper functions. These are now
          based on GNU iconv and are in their own file, convert_utf.h/c.  They now
          take a length parameter for safety against buffer overflows. The Unicode, Inc.
          implementations in ConvertUTF.h/c have been removed.


03 Feb 2009 - svn revision 856
Version 1.7.3
[ David Bruce <davidstuartbruce@gmail.com> ]
        - updated LoadFont() to include the hard-coded hackery for all of the
          bundled fonts.  Also, (IMPORTANT), now the function attempts to load
          the default font if it fails to load the desired font, instead of 
          just segfaulting.  An appropriate message is printed to stderr.
        - fix to ConvertToUTF8() to support correct behavior on MacOSX
        - fix to top-level Makefile.am because a file was going into $prefix/doc/PACKAGE
          rather than the correct $prefix/share/doc/PACKAGE

14 Jan 2009 - svn revision 856
[ David Bruce <davidstuartbruce@gmail.com> ]
        - fixed SetupPaths() - really, the correct path should _always_ be 
          DATA_PREFIX, and SetupPaths() should just confirm that and check for
          the theme data path under it.  There should be no need for the hard-
          coded choices, which were just covering up the mistake.

Version 1.7.2
[ David Bruce <davidstuartbruce@gmail.com> ]
        - fixed crashing bug in cascade game in fullscreen due to size of blit
          queue not being big enough.
        - fixed drawing glitch in cascade game where words with terminal 'W' had
          not been getting fully erased in redraw
        - changed title graphic to "TuxType" instead of "TuxType2"
        - added opening sound "harp.wav" from Tux Paint.
        - added rest of fonts needed for remaining Indic languages
        - changed "warning" output from image loader so it only prints if debug on.

12 Jan 2009 - svn revision 841
Version 1.7.1
[ David Bruce <davidstuartbruce@gmail.com> ]
        - additional code to work around unreliability of setlocale() under 
          Windows. We now set LANG for both the C compiler and OS as well, using
          Bruno Haible's my_setenv() function from the GNU Gettext FAQ. Tuxtype
          now starts in the correct language for the underlying OS, and also
          switches translations with theme changes. It does not yet automatically
          pick the correct theme on startup to match the current LANG.
        - additional code in ConvertToUTF8() to handle Windows' 16-bit wchar_t vs.
          unix's 32-bit wchar_t.

          argument so it again plays nicely with "Lessons"

13 Oct 2008 - svn revision 760
[ David Bruce <davidstuartbruce@gmail.com> ]
        - Lots more work on fullscreen mode with Fish Cascade working but a little slow
        - Practice activity extensively reworked - wrapping of arbitrary length phrases,
          rearrangement of screen layout, fullscreen mode supported, animated Tux icons,
          onscreen display of time, chars, words per min, accuracy with gettext support.

22 Aug 2008 - svn revision 668
[ David Bruce <davidstuartbruce@gmail.com> ]
        - Extensive revision to support fullscreen mode at resolution of OS rather than only 640x480.
          Menu system and comet zap work, fish cascade now works in fullscreen but cannot handle
          toggle of resolution in midstream; practice and lessons still need to be fixed to 
          handle new fullscreen mode.
        - Using GNU iconv() instead of Unicode Inc.'s conversion code
        - SDL_extras brought in from tuxmath for DrawButton(), streamlined BlackOutline(), etc.

       - new branch made called "tuxtype-new", code reorganized with
       - more standard subdirs "src", "data", "doc"; Makefile.am's
         and configure.ac updated accordingly.  After some tweaking,

       - added an Indic language theme, Malayalam, which also contains a 
         lesson area.
       - new format of keyboard.lst for malayalam theme (now added to other

         display in the practice session. Also did a major role in adding 
         Unicode support in the practice area.
       - removed old keymap that was limited to Unicode chars 0-255 (now
         replaced by a scheme that can support any chars in Unicode).
       - added series of XML lessons for Malayalam theme.

         practice phrases.
       - simplified format of keyboard.lst - each line now just
         gives the fingering for a single character (e.g. "0|a").
         The code to read in the keyboard.lst has been replaced.
         All keyboard.lst files in the themes are updated to the
         new format, however the Russian and Greek keyboard.lst files
         are erroneous and prevent these themes from working.
         TuxType now relies on the keyboard.lst files to tell it
         what characters are permissible in the typing activities.
         (If anyone knows of a cross-platform way to find out from
         the OS what Unicode values are "typable" with the user's
         current keyboard setup, please let me know!).

       - practice.c revised significantly to prevent crashes if
         keyboard.lst erroneous or incomplete - if entry not found
         in FINGER[] array for a character, fingering hint not
         shown but program still functions. "Practice" now uses the
         same RenderLetters() code as the Cascade and Comet Zap
         activities.
       - BlackOutLine() for single letters now uses 
         TTF_RenderUNICODE_Blended() rather than
         TTF_RenderGlyph_Blended() because the former version
         renders all glyphs to a consistent baseline, simplifying
         our code.

26 Aug 2007
[ David Bruce ]
       - got rid of autogen.sh - autoreconf is recommended way to
         do the same thing according to autotools folks.
       - replaced acinclude.m4 with newer version to get rid of 
         "underquoted AM_PATH_SDL" message.
       - fixed bug causing crash on exit from cascade game do to 
         double free of ptr.
       - fixed bug with Espanol display of menus.
       - added "static" keyword to file-scope variables.
       - moved more of global variables to file or local scope.
       - added hard-coded hack-work to LoadFont() to support
         Rachana and Doulos as well as Andika in Debian.

v 1.5.11
19 Aug 2007
[ David Bruce ]
       - Further development of settings struct.
       - Got rid of realPath[] - paths now part of settings struct.
       - program now looks for a settings file under the theme dir
         when a theme is selected, allowing themes to specify a 
         preferred font (or other settings).
       - Incorporated most of changes from TuxType-Indic branch.
         Program will now require SDLPango (as well as pango itself
         and glib) - for now, pango-related code #ifndef-ed out for
         win32 until I figure out how to get Windows build to work.

01 Aug 2007
[ David Bruce ]
       - Removed KEYMAP array - wasn't being used correctly anyway.
       - Consolidated many global vars into settings struct.
       - code cleanup.

v 1.5.10 - 16 Jun 2007
[ David Bruce ]
       - Added ConvertUTF.c & .h from Unicode, Inc. to do UTF-8 to wcs
         encoding conversion when glibc isn't present (i.e., in Windows
         build). AFAICT, Windows build now handles UTF-8/Unicode properly,
         or at least behaves the same as *nix build.
       - Fixed Jamaican theme - words in list needed to be uppercase.
       - Correct links in HowToTheme.html to current counterparts.

15 Jun 2007
[ David Bruce ]
       - Comet Zap fixed to require player to type letters in proper
         order - "shootable" flag added to comet type.
       - More code cleanup - mostly adding checks to prevent dereferencing
         of null or invalid pointers.

07 Jun 2007
[ David Bruce ]
       - Code cleanup - funcs.h revised, unneeded "extern" keywords for
         function prototypes removed, prototypes rearranged into alpha-
         betical order
       - All functions now have function prototypes, either in funcs.h or
         local function prototypes with explicit static scope.
       - const keyword added to pointer function args when appropriate,
         usually char* args.
       - Renaming of some functions and variables to make capitalization 
         more internally consistent (e.g. ALLCAPS means constant or other
         preprocessor macro, CamelCase means globally visible, while 
         local_functions() use lowercase connected by underscores).

29 May 2007
[ David Bruce ]
       - Fixed vertical alignment problem with certain non-US characters
         such as "Å" by checking max_y of each glyph and adjusting
         appropriately.
       - Added Doulos font to svn to accomodate Russian, although no code
         yet to use this font when it is needed.
       - Added utility function to print keymap - it appears that the
         existing keymap code is broken, as the KEYMAP[] array winds
         up with KEYMAP[i] == i for all values no matter what the
         keyboard.lst file says.

24 May 2007
[ David Bruce ]
       - Additional work on UTF-8/Unicode issues - program now scans
         word list to see what Unicode characters are needed instead
         of automatically rendering everything from 0-255. It now
         displays chars beyond this range (e.g. Russian/Cyrillic) as
         long as the font contains the needed glyphs (which Andika 
         does not, as of yet). Display "should" now work correctly
         except for a cosmetic problem with vertical alignment, which
         should be fixed soon. Files - alphabet.c, playgame.c, laser.c.
       - Lowercase keystrokes for non-US characters converted to upper-
         case, just like A-Z.  Not sure this addresses keyboard input
         problems just yet.
       - Changed font to Andika design review "G".

v.1.5.9  07 May 2007

[ David Bruce ]
       - Overhauled internal handling of word lists to handle UTF-8
         correctly. Now WORDS_use() converts the UTF-8 to wchar_t
         (i.e. Unicode) arrays for internal handling. The letters for
         the fish and comets are now generated by black_outline_wchar(),
         which is a modification of black_outline() that uses
         TTF_RenderGlyph() instead of TTF_RenderUTF8().  It now seems
         to work correctly, but for now is limited to the 0-255 range.

v.1.5.8  29 Apr 2007

[ Karl Ove Hufthammer ]
       - Converted all the translation to use the UTF-8 characters.
       - Changed word files to UTF-8. 
	   - Added improved French word files commited by the French
	     Skolelinux/Debian-edu team during DevCamp in Soissons.
	   - Added Brazilian Portuguese translation by
	     Hudson Gonçalves Manieri Figueredo.

[ David Bruce ]
       - Changed TTF_RenderText to TTF_RenderUTF8 everywhere in 
         playgame.c, mainly by removing ttf_letter() and using
         black_outline() instead.
       - Added some checks for null pointers to prevent segfaults.
       - Changed backgrounds from png to jpg to save space.
       - Removed other unused backgrounds
         (now in people/dbruce/unused_images)

[ David Bruce ] 21 Apr 2007
       - (mostly) removed used of checkFile() as it doesn't work
         reliably on Windows and isn't really necessary. 


v.1.5.7

[ David Bruce ]
       - Changed font to Andika (hopefully will have this in Debian
         and other OS in future so we don't have to bundle it
         indefinitely)
       - Fixed black_outline() to make it work more or less as was
         intended, from what I can tell.

v1.5.6	the "make it simply work, stupid" release (a pun on KISS)

[ Holger Levsen ]
       - tagged as release in svn
       - brought back the tuxtype2 logo
       - updated TODO and README
       - reverted utf8-changes from r16-20, as utf8 support needs more code
         changes
       - workaround debian bug #374062
       - remove funkbrt.it as its not used
       - font-loading is still a ugly hack :-( but works on debian with
         ttf-gentium, which requires a little code-change for a sarge backport
       - macosx and windows version untested...

v1.5.5   development version, not released (still font+sound issues)

[ Calvin Arndt ]
       - closing all the mem leaks I know of 
       - remove redundant print_phrase()
       - remove hard coded xy positions in print_at() (calculate wrapped y position)
       - remove uneeded cast in Phrases()
[ Holger Levsen ]
       - renamed to tuxtype (from tuxtype2), also modified the logo :)
       - Solving the sound file licence issues (removed one (tickle.wav, was
         unused), updated README_SOUNDS.TXT - this is not finished yet!!!!
       - removed all fonts. The font-handling is still a hack,
         see loaders.c - it only uses fonts from ttf-freefont
         and not yet from ttf-dejavu (for non-latini fonts) - and it only
         works on Debian probably (fixed path, not suitable for Windows,
         MacOS and probably other linux distributions)

v1.5.4 - Added Norwegian Bokmål translation. Improved Norwegian
         Nynorsk translation.

v1.5.3 - Initial lesson code started. Changed Set Keyboard to
	 be a project info page. Fixed CometZap random segfaults on
	 versions of NT. Added scripting for lessons. Used scripting
	 mimic old instructions for Fish Cascade. Replaced
	 SDL_WM_ToggleFullScreen() in favor of a more portable 
	 routine to accomplish window size toggling. F10 in menu
	 toggles screen size. Added saving sound volumes and windows
	 state in the config file. Tuxtype2 now remembers both!
	 Added translations Euskara, Italian and Jamaican. Added
	 code for a map and photo for each theme/translation.

v1.5.1 - Changed to get word list name from first line of file.
         More language fixes. Added spanish translation. Fix 
	 typos in source. Build system fixes. Added spanish
	 translation. New word files for nynorsk translation.
	 Danish translation bug fixes and cleanup. Changed format
	 of keyboard.lst file. Added mouse click selection in language
	 screen. And much more. Enjoy!

v1.5.0 - First release in almost a year!!!

v.0.2 - First elliminated need for SDL_Plus (which was useless
        anyway.)

v.0.3 - FIRST WORKING VERSION OF KEYCASCADE! Works at all
        difficulty settings and levels.

        asside from a /few/ minor quirks). Also added soundFX
        and music as well as tutorial for KeyCascade.

v.0.4pre2 - Fixed WaitFrame() usage (more coherent now)
        Also ensured that frame rate can stay constant over
        different speed systems, and added --speed option.

v.0.4 - Switched from UpdateRect to SDL_Flip() on title screen to
	try to ensure constant frame-rate on title screen across
	platforms. Various bug-fixes. Added surface based cursor
	to titlescreen to prevent cursor-loss on certain systems
	(such as my laptop >:/ )
	
v.0.5pre1 - Begin work on WORDCASCADE: All screens found and added-
	Added word loading option and words- levels cycle- not
	yet playable. Also fixed permissions on "missing" as well
	as added the special hidden option (see readme in image dir).
	
v.0.5pre2 - WORDCASCADE now works. May need minor tweaking as time
  goes by... but I will deal with that eventuality when it occurs.

v.0.5 - Work on docs, small bugfixes for release.

v.0.5-2 - Second 0.5 release. Fixed embarrasing word file location
	problem!!!
	
v.0.6 - Many Mandrake 7.2 fixes. "Free Typing" added. Various code
	clean-up and bugfixes.

   bug (thx to Rich Bellamy <bellamrm@clarkson.edu>)

v.0.9pre2 - Fixed many of the troubles causing the tutorial screen
   crashes:
   (http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=414339&group_id=12715&atid=112715)

v.0.9pre3 - Added code from Olivier Dagenais <olivier_dagenais@canada.com>
   which allows for compilation under Win32 using MS VisualC++. Also
   fixed Kdevelop/SDL integration issues which prevents Tux Typing from
   compiling on other OSes.

    hard defaults to easy defaults. Fixed word cascade bug:
    http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=104456&repeatmerged=yes

v1.0.1 - Build process bugfix.
