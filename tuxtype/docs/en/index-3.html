Tux Typing can be started by typing "tuxtype" on the command line. The game consists
of three basic areas: Key Cascade, Word Cascade, and the Practice/Tutorals. The Practice/Tutorial
section of the game will be covered in section 4.
<p>
<h2><a name="ss3.1">3.1 Command Line Options</a></h2>
<p>
As with most Unix applications, Tux Typing can take a number of command line options.
 These options range from switching between full-screen and windowed mode to accessing
 debugging information.
 <p>
 In keeping with the GNU standard, passing the "--help", "-help", or "-h" options will
 display a help message with a list of presently available command lines<a
 href="index-3.html#hidden">*</a>.
 <p>
 <blockquote><code>
 <pre>
$ ./tuxtype --help

Usage:
 tuxtype [OPTION]...

Options:

        -h, --help, -help
                Prints this help message

        -f, --fullscreen
                Selects fullscreen display (default)

        -w, --window
                Selects windowed display (not fullscreen)

        -s, --sound
                Allow in-game sounds (default)

        -ns, --nosound
                Disables in-game sounds

        -t {THEME}, --theme {THEME}
                Use theme named {THEME}, if it exists

        -sp, --speed
                Speed up gameplay (for use on slower
                machines)

        -a, --alpha
                Use transparencies to emphasize faster falling
                words (will decrease performance)

        -st, --static
                Static (non-scrolling) setting (helps on systems
                where mouse disappears)

        -v, --version
                Display version number and exit

        -vb, --verbose
                Select verbose output (for debugging)
                (Warning! Verbose is /very/ verbose!)

</pre></code></blockquote>
<p>
Let's run through these options quickly to give an overview of what a few of them do.
<p>
<blockquote><code><pre>

        -f, --fullscreen
                Selects fullscreen display (default)

        -w, --window
                Selects windowed display (not fullscreen)
</pre></code></blockquote>
These first two options deal with the display settings of the game. SDL has the
ability to run its applications in a window within your desktop, or fullscreen
(over your desktop). The fullscreen mode is the default for Tux Typing.
<p>Running the game in fullscreen may require that your X server be set to allow for
multiple resolution modes for best results (even if your X server is not set up
correctly for this, you will still get fullscreen- but it may be a smaller window
within a screen of black). To properly tune your X server, please consult Eric
S. Raymond's excellent XFree86 Video Timings HOWTO (at the <a
href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">LDP</a>). You may also wish to use xvidtune.
<p>
<blockquote><code><pre>

        -s, --sound
                Allow in-game sounds (default)

        -ns, --nosound
                Disables in-game sounds
</pre></code></blockquote>
Next we find options for enabling and disabling sound in the game. By default, the
game sound is enabled. There is really not much more to say about these options.
<p>
<blockquote><code><pre>

        -sp, --speed
                Speed up gameplay (for use on slower
                machines)
</pre></code></blockquote>
This option removes the frame delay from between each frame in the game. The result
is faster gameplay (or it should be;)
<p>
The frame delay is intended to reduce flicker and tear of the graphics by waiting
to redraw the screen between vertical refreshes of your monitor. However,
on machines with less resources (smaller RAM, slower CPUs, etc.) the act of drawing
each frame may actually take as long or longer than the delay between refreshes.
On such systems, the extra delay in frame redrawing can really slow the game
down.
<p>
By giving the option of removing this frame delay, players with less beefy machines
can still enjoy the game at a speed closer to that intended.
<p>
This option additionally gives the experienced player on a more powerful machine the
ability to ramp up the difficulty beyond that pre-set in the game by speeding things
up.
<p>
<blockquote><code><pre>

        -st, --static
                Static (non-scrolling) setting (helps on systems
                where mouse disappears)
</pre></code></blockquote>
When I play the game on my laptop, for some very strange reason my mouse cursor
occassionally disappears in the titlescreen. I found that when I stopped scrolling the
background, my mouse would reappear.
<p>This option allows the user to stop the scrolling background on the titlescreen.
It helps on systems where the mouse cursor disappears, or where other graphic oddities
occur on the title screen.
<p>
It can also help increase the speed of execution on the title screen. This can be
useful on systems with less power (and can be used in conjunction with the "-sp"/"--speed"
option.)
<p><blockquote><code><pre>

        -t {THEME}, --theme {THEME}
                Use theme named {THEME}, if it exists
</pre></code></blockquote>
This command will allow you to pick an alternative theme for the game. This theme must
have already been installed (see <a href="index-2.html#ss2.4">section 2.4</a> for more
information). Note that if the theme is not installed, Tux Typing will use the default
theme.

<p><blockquote><code><pre>
        -a, --alpha
                Use transparencies to emphasize faster falling
                words (will decrease performance)
</pre></code></blockquote>
When we fixed the clipping bug around 1.0pre1, we found that words could become jumbled
and difficult to determine for some players in the Word Cascade. To appease these players,
we added this option which blits slow moving words with a 50% transparency. This helps
emphasize those words which are moving faster (since those are usually more important). The
problem is that playing the game this way seemed to confuse many other players. So, the option
was left in via a command line toggle for the end-user to decide which mode they prefer.
<p>
Note that on some hardware this option can greatly decrease performance!
<p><blockquote><code><pre>

        -vb, --verbose
                Select verbose output (for debugging)
                (Warning! Verbose is /very/ verbose!)
</pre></code></blockquote>
This option causes debugging information to be displayed. It is useful when tracking
down problems and submitting bug reports (see <a href="index-5.html">section 5</a>
for more information).
<p>
One bit of warning, this prints out a great deal of debugging information and
can greatly slow the gameplay down.
<p>
Most of these options can be combined with as many other options as you want. For
example, if you wanted to play the game in windowed mode with no sound, no frame
delay, and running in full verbose mode, you could type:
<blockquote><code><pre>
% tuxtype -w -ns -sp -vb
</pre></code></blockquote>
Also note that there is no defined order or sequence these options must be in on the
command line. You are free to mix and match, order and limit as you choose.
<p>
<i><a name="hidden">*:</a> NOTE: By passing the command line option "-h"/"-help"/"--help"
you will not actually get <b>all</b> possible command line options. There may or
may not exist an extra option which is not mentionned by "help". I will leave
it up to you to discover what that option is. (Recall, this is "open-source"
software ;)</i>
<p>
<h2><a name="ss3.2">3.2 Game Play Types</a></h2>
<p>
There are two basic game play types: Key Cascade and Word Cascade. These types
exersize key location skills and word typing skills respectively. Both types
are played in very similar ways but with subtle (yet significant) differences.
<p>
The object of both game types is to guide Tux to eat a certain number of fish
without letting too many fish get past him.
<p>
There are three different difficulties for each game play type: Easy, Medium, and
Hard. Depending upon which difficulty level you choose to play the game at, the
fish fall at different speeds and have different spacing between them. At the
highest difficulty settings some fish fall faster than others, forcing you
to anticipate those that will hit first.
<p>
Every difficulty level also has four sub-levels of increasing difficulty which
you have to negotiate through in order to win the game.
<P>
<h3><A NAME="ss3.2.1">3.2.1 Key Cascade</A></h3>
<p>
In Key Cascade, fish fall from the top of the screen with letters on them. To
make Tux move underneath them to eat the fish, you must press the key that
corresponds to the letter on the fish before the fish falls too far.
<p>
Each time a fish hits the ground, Tux loses a life. When he has lost all of his lives,
the game is over.
In every sub-level, Tux has a certain number of fish that he must eat in order to
proceed to the next sub-level. When he has eaten enough fish, he is congratulated
and allowed to move on.
<p>
When Tux prepares to eat a fish, he first moves underneath that fish. He then waits
for the fish to drop low enough for him to eat it. If the fish is far enough above
the ground, then Tux will leisurely walk to where he will intercept the fish.
However, if the fish is very close to the ground, or Tux is far enough away, Tux may
have to run to get to the fish. If Tux cannot get to the fish before it hits the
ground, he will not be able to eat it, and the fish will splat on the ground.
<P>
Once you have pressed a key and made Tux move underneath a fish to eat, you must wait
with Tux until he eats that fish before pressing another key. If you press another
key, Tux will move to the fish with that key. This is useful if you discover that
there is another fish falling faster than the one you selected, but can cause you
problems if you are too impatient.
<p>
If Tux is in the way of a fish he is not going to eat, we will step out of the way,
excusing himself. Unless Tux is told to eat that fish, it will splat on the ground
and Tux will lose a life.
<p>
<h3><a name="ss3.2.2">3.2.2 Word Cascade</a></h3>
<p>
In Word Cascade, fish fall from the top of the screen with words on them. To
make Tux move underneath them to eat the fish, you must type the word that is
written on the fish before the fish falls too far.
<p>
Each time a fish hits the ground, Tux loses a life. When he has lost all of his lives,
the game is over.
In every sub-level, Tux has a certain number of fish that he must eat in order to
proceed to the next sub-level. When he has eaten enough fish, he is congratulated
and allowed to move on.
<p>
When Tux prepares to eat a fish, he first moves underneath that fish. He then waits
for the fish to drop low enough for him to eat it. If the fish is far enough above
the ground, then Tux will leisurely walk to where he will intercept the fish.
However, if the fish is very close to the ground, or Tux is far enough away, Tux may
have to run to get to the fish. If Tux cannot get to the fish before it hits the
ground, he will not be able to eat it, and the fish will splat on the ground.
<P>
Once you have typed the apropriate word and made Tux move underneath a fish to eat, you must wait
with Tux until he eats that fish before typing another word. If you type a new word,
 Tux will move to the fish with that word. This is useful if you discover that
there is another fish falling faster than the one you selected, but can cause you
problems if you are too impatient.
