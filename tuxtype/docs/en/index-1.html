Tux Typing is a graphical typing tutorial game for children. It stars "Tux", the Linux Penguin.
 The object of the game is to guide Tux to fish falling from the top of the screen so that he can eat them.
 Each fish has a letter or a word on it. To make Tux eat that fish (or group of fish), you must type either
 the letter or the word.<br><br>

Tux Typing is free software, distributed under the Gnu GPL. It was written for Linux using
Simple Direct Media Layer Libraries. Because of this, and the fact the Tux Typing's source
code is freely available, it should be easy to port it to other operating systems (provided
they have SDL ported already).<br><br>

Currently Tux Typing is available in binary form for the following platforms:
<blockquote>
<ul>
        <li>Linux (x86)</li>
        <li>Microsoft Windows</li>
        <li>BeOS (x86)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
