Briefly, here is what we are working on for GSoC 2009:

Tuxtype:
  - svg support
  - addition of user-specific search path for word and phrase lists, so people can add their own content more readily.
  - config/admin tool using gui toolkit (e.g. Qt4 but could be something else)
  - perhaps LAN support

Tuxmath:
  - svg support
  - config/admin tool using gui toolkit (e.g. Qt4 but could be something else)
  - LAN multiplayer mode - need refactoring into client/server architecture (could be applied to tuxtype also).

As you can see, the ideas are similar for both programs.

Apart from GSoC, both programs need ongoing code cleanup, especially tuxtype.  Also, tuxtype could benefit greatly at this point from a refresh of things other than the C code itself - high-resolution backgrounds, completion of rest of menu sprite icons, more word lists and phrase files, etc. 

-check that SVN is free of generated files. create release-script,
